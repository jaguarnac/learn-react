# learn-react

Learning react here.

##Learning from W3Schools

1. Firstly, started learning react from w3schools as that was top most result for googling "Learn ReactJS"
2. Tried out react program of "Hello world!" within html file in w3schools/first-react.html
3. Later continued to update my node and npm on Windows 10 machine.
4. Tried out another node based react app in w3schools/myfirstreact folder. Being default app, I simply scanned app.js file.
5. Later discovered a "learn react" link in the demo app when I ran it using `npm start`.
6. I'll follow the new tutorial here onwards. The tutorial is about building tic-tac-toe game.
7. In process I plan to make it accessible using aria grid design pattern.
